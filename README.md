# Adversarial Examples on Neural Networks (3D Point Cloud Classification)

This is my final year research project on adversarial example attacks on 3D point cloud classification models. 
In this project, I have evaluated existing different defence strategies on the following metrics:
- Accuracy under Attack
- Robustness Gain
- Computational overhead

I have used the PointNet model implementation from the [learning3d](https://github.com/vinits5/learning3d) repository by [@vinits5](https://github.com/vinits5) to perform my experiments. More specifically, I have used the train_pointnet.py file found in the learning3d/examples folder and modified it to fit my project requirements.
